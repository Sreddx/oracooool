## Summary

This React operator creates a page for a web application that allows people to learn about the Formula 1 rules, make predictions, share predictions with users, and tracks the points they've accumulated in a leaderboard.

## Inputs

This operator imports a number of components from the "@mui/material" library to build the visual interface of the Predictions page. Additionally, it imports an API module (`oracoooolAPI`) for making HTTP requests to get data about drivers, circuits and making predictions. 

Leadboard data is hardcoded here for the purpose of demonstration but can be replaced with real-time fetched data.

`secondaryNavbar`: An existing secondary navigation bar component is passed as a prop to be rendered in this component.

## Parameters

A number of state variables are being used to store and control the component's data displayed on the page:

- `selectedTrackId`: Stores the id of the selected track on which the prediction is to be made.
- `results`: Stores the result of the prediction.
- `allPilots`: Stores the list fetched list of all pilots.
- `trackOptions`: Stores fetched list of possible tracks for selection.
- `selectedPreviousPredictionsTrackId`: Stores the id of the selected track whose previous predictions are to be displayed.
- `previousPredictionsTrackOptions`: Stores fetched list of previous predictions' tracks.
- `previousPredictionsResults`: Stores fetched previous predictions.
- `selectedPilots`: Stores user selected pilots for which prediction is to be made.

The useEffect hook calls two async functions `getTracks` and `getDrivers` at the component's initial mount to fetch the list of tracks and drivers.

## Outputs

This component returns a page that shows users, their points, and allows users to make predictions for races including the ability to select tracks and drivers for the prediction. It also allows users to view the past predictions. The data about users comes from some existing 'leaderboard' data.

## Functionality

On rendering, `useEffect` hook is used to make initial API calls to fetch data about drivers and tracks. 

The `handleTrackSelect` and `handlePilotSelect` functions handle the selections of a track and pilots respectively. 

The `handlePredictClick` function makes an API call to fetch the model's prediction when a user clicks the "View prediction" button. 

The `clearPrediction` function resets the track selection.

The Leaderboard and prediction details are rendered inside the `Box` component. The `TableContainer` component renders the leaderboard where for each user, their profile, points and options to make/view predictions are rendered inside an `Accordion` component. 

Finally, there's a similar leaderboard for displaying all users except the current one.
