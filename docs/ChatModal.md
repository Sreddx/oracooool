# ChatModal Component Documentation

## Summary
The `ChatModal` component is a functional component in React that creates a floating chat icon, which, when clicked, opens a chatbot modal window.

## Inputs
This component does not directly receive any input props. However, it uses other components such as `IconButton`, `Modal`, `ChatIcon`, and `ChatComponent`.

## Parameters
Parameters within the `ChatModal` component include:
- `open`: A state variable that toggles the visibility of the chat modal.
- `handleOpen`: A function that sets `open` to true, causing the chat modal to appear.
- `handleClose`: A function that sets `open` to false, causing the chat modal to disappear.
- `style`: An object that contains CSS styles for positioning the chat icon at the lower-right corner of the viewport.
- `modalStyle`: An object that contains CSS styles for positioning and styling the modal.

## Outputs
This component outputs a fixed-position chat icon that opens a modal containing the ChatComponent when clicked.

## Functionality
- `handleOpen` function: This function is called when the IconButton (Chat Icon) is clicked. It changes the state of `open` to `true` which results in the modal being displayed.
- `handleClose` function: This function is called when the modal is intended to be closed. It changes the state of `open` to `false` which results in the modal being hidden.
- `ChatModal`: This is the main functional component which returns JSX. The JSX returned is a `div` that includes an IconButton (Chat Icon) and a Modal. The IconButton, when clicked, triggers the `handleOpen` function and opens the chat modal. The Modal contains the `ChatComponent` (chatbot) and is visible based on the state of the `open` variable.
  
The `ChatModal` component is useful in providing a user interface for a chatbot in the web application. Also, it could be used as a part of an application that provides information about formula 1 rules, drivers, teams, and allows users to make and share predictions.
