# Documentation

## Summary
This code defines several classes that can represent various entities in a racing simulation system. Each class has several attributes to hold information and a method to democratize that information for use in other systems.

## Inputs
There are no explicit inputs for this operator as it represents a series of classes that can be instantiated with parameters.

## Parameters
Each class has various parameters depending on what is required to describe each entity appropriately. For example, the `User` class takes parameters such as `id`, `name`, `username`, `password`, `profile_picture`, `bio`, `points` etc. to represent information about a user.

## Outputs
This code does not directly produce an output but creates class objects that can then be used to generate other outputs. Each class has a `d` method which generates a dictionary of attribute-value pairs that represent the object.

## Functionality
1. **Driver Class:** This class represents the information of a racing driver, including details like their team, nationality, image, and name.
2. **Team Class:** Used to define details of a team, including the name, team description, and the description of the car.
3. **Group Class:** This class defines various groups in the system, including a unique identifier, a name, and a description of the group.
4. **User Class:** Holds information about a user, including a unique identifier, name, username, and other relevant user information.
5. **Circuit Class:** Holds information about a racing circuit, including a unique identifier, name, description, country, city, image, and the length of the circuit.
6. **NextResult Class:** This class holds data about the next race result, including the driver, circuit, and the predicted result.
7. **Prediction Class:** Responsible for holding information about a specific prediction, including the ID of the prediction, the user who made the prediction, the circuit it refers to, the year of the prediction, and the results.

The `d` method in all classes returns a dictionary of the class' attributes which aids in data serialization and transportation. Some classes like `User` have two versions of this method, detailed and minor, to return either all or a selection of the object's data.
