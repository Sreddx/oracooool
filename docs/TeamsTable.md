# Documentation for TeamTable Component

## Summary:
The `TeamTable` component in React is responsible for fetching and displaying the information on various Formula 1 teams in a table format.

## Inputs:
This component does not take any props as inputs.

## Parameters:
This component uses the following state variables and methods:

- `teams`: A state variable holding an array of team data
- `setTeams`: A method to update the `teams` state variable 
- `fetchTeams`: An asynchronous helper function responsible for fetching the team data from the specified API endpoint.

## Outputs:
This component returns a rendered table filled with team information, including team name, description, and car description.

## Functionality:

The `TeamTable` component operates in the following way:

- On the initial render, the `useEffect` hook invokes the `fetchTeams` function. This function fetches team data from a designated API endpoint and populates the `teams` state variable with this data, catching and logging any errors that may occur during this process. 

- The component then renders a table including headers for "Name", "Description", and "Car Description". 

- It maps over the `teams` array, creating a new table row (`<tr>`) for each team. Each row contains table data (`<td>`) elements for the team's name, description, and car description.

The `TeamTable` component is exported as default for usage in other parts of the application.
