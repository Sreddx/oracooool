### Summary
This code describes two route handlers ("my_predict" and "get_prediction") for a web application that allows users to learn about Formula 1, make predictions about the outcomes of races, and share these predictions with their friends. These route handlers form part of the predictions module of the application, backed by a machine learning model and requiring user login for data retrieval and prediction submission.

### Inputs
The inputs for these route handlers primarily come from HTTP requests. Specifically, these inputs include:

- For `my_predict`, JSON data containing a `circuit` input and a `preds` input that consists of a list of predictions.
- For `get_prediction`, the user id and circuit id specified in the URL.

Input data is retrieved and parsed from the HTTP request for use in the application.

### Parameters
Parameters are parsed from the inputs and include:

- For `my_predict`, a `user_id` extracted from the JWT (JSON Web Token) of the request, as well as a `circuit_id` and a list of `preds` parsed from the provided JSON data.
- For `get_prediction`, a `user_id` and `circuit_id` parsed from the URL and validated.

These parameters are used to interact with the application's database and facilitate the retrieval or creation of predictions.

### Outputs
These route handlers provide responses in the form of JSON objects. The outputs include:

- For `my_predict`, a response indicating the successful creation of a prediction or an error message.
- For `get_prediction`, a response containing the requested prediction or an error message.

These outputs are used to communicate the results of the user's request back to them.

### Functionality
These route handlers function by taking in HTTP requests, parsing and validating the input data, interacting with the application's database to create or retrieve predictions, and returning the results in the form of HTTP responses.

`my_predict` is a POST method which accepts a JSON payload, parses it into respective fields (`user_id`, `circuit_id`, and `preds`). It validates the inputs and proceeds to create a new prediction using the provided inputs. In case of an exception, appropriate errors are returned to the client.

`get_prediction` is a GET method which accepts `user_id` and `circuit_id` as URL parameters. It retrieves a prediction corresponding to the `user_id` and `circuit_id`. If an error occurs during this process, it is caught and returned to the client.
