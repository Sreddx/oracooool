# Documentation 

## Summary
This operator provides functionalities related to the User and Group objects within databases such as retrieving user's groups, creating groups, joining or removing groups, retrieving all users from a specific group, and getting data of all users.

## Inputs
- user_id: UUID of the user.
- group_id: UUID of the group.
- name: Name of the new group to be created.
- description: Description of the new group to be created.
- owner: UUID of the user who will be the owner of the new group.

## Parameters
- q: SQL query string that will be executed in the functions.
- data: Tuple of data that will be used in the SQL query.
- cur: The cursor object from the PostgreSQL database.
- result: The result returned by executing the SQL query.

## Outputs
- get_my_groups: List of Group objects that the user is part of.
- create_a_group: A new Group object.
- join_group: Returns True if the operation was successful else return False.
- remove_group: Returns True if the operation was successful else return False.
- get_all_users_from_group: List of User objects within a specific group.
- get_all_users: List of all User objects, ordered by points.

## Functionality
The code is a collection of functions that interact with the database, involving User and Group objects.

- get_my_groups: Returns all groups a specific user is part of, by executing 'GET_MY_GROUPS' query with the user's UUID as data.
- create_a_group: Creates a new group with a specified name, description, and owner by executing 'CREATE_A_GROUP' query, then assigns the owner to the group with 'ADD_USER_TO_GROUP' query.
- join_group: Allows a user to join a group by executing 'ADD_USER_TO_GROUP' query with the user's and group's UUIDs as data.
- remove_group: Removes a user from a group by executing 'REMOVE_USER_FROM_GROUP' query with the user's and group's UUIDs as data.
- get_all_users_from_group: Retrieves all users from a specific group by executing 'GET_ALL_USERS_FROM_GROUP' query with the group's UUID as data.
- get_all_users: Retrieves all users ordered by their points by executing 'GET_ALL_USERS_ORDERED_BY_POINTS' query with no data.

Each function establishes a connection with the database, executes a SQL query, fetches the result if there is one, and returns the appropriate objects or statuses. Exception handling in the join_group, remove_group, get_all_users_from_group, and get_all_users functions, ensures any issues encountered during querying are printed out, and functions continue executing without breaking down abruptly.
