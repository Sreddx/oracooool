# Summary
This web application functionalities feature a group-based feature that allows authenticated users to get groups, join or remove groups, create a new group, get users in a group and get all users. 

# Inputs:
The application accepts various HTTP methods, namely POST and GET, through which JSON payloads or URL parameters are passed. The user inputs are the information from the userâ€™s JWT token and the group handling requests and endpoints.

1. **User JWT token**: The users' identity is fetched using the JWT token provided by the user in the cookies.
2. **Group ID (str)**: An identifier for unique groups. This is used in several endpoints such as '/group_id/people', '/group_id/join' and '/group_id/remove'.
3. **'name' and 'description' (str)**: These are used when creating a new group through the '/' POST request.

# Parameters:
Each function decorator defined corresponds to an HTTP endpoint. Endpoint details and the respective parameters they handle are as follows:

1. **@groups.route("/", methods=["GET"])**: This route doesn't accept any parameter, it lists the groups available to the currently authenticated user.
2. **@groups.route("/<group_id>/people", methods=["GET"])**: Accepts a group_id as a URL parameter, returns all users in the specified group.
3. **@groups.route("/<group_id>/join", methods=["POST"])**: Accepts a group_id, this endpoint allows a user to join a specified group.
4. **@groups.route("/<group_id>/remove", methods=["POST"])**: Accepts a group_id, this endpoint allows a user to leave a specified group.
5. **@groups.route("/", methods=["POST"])**: Accepts JSON payload that includes 'name' and 'description'. This route is used to create a new group.
6. **@groups.route("/allusers", methods=["GET"])**: This route doesn't accept any parameter, it lists all users in the application.

# Outputs:
All functionalities output a JSON response with varying details based on the functionality's boundary:

1. **User Object**: A JSON object containing a user's details.
2. **Group Object**: A JSON object containing a group's details.
3. **Errors**: If there is any error (like incorrect inputs or server problems), a JSON object containing the error description is returned.

# Functionality:

The application user-based access control leveraging blueprints and route decorators from Flask and JSON-web-tokens for user authentication. This offers handy group manipulations. Data parsing, validation, and exception handling are performed for each endpoint. The database function module `db.func.groups` is used to perform the necessary data handling for the groups. In case of exceptions, appropriate HTTP response codes and error messages are bundled into a response payload.
