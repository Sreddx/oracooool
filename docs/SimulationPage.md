## Summary

This is a React.js component for a Simulation Page in a web application. This component allows the user to select a Formula 1 track, make a prediction using a machine learning model, and display the predicted results in a tabular format.

## Inputs

The Simulation Page component receives a single prop:

- `secondaryNavbar`: This is a React structure that is rendered at the top of the page. It is expected to be a secondary navigation bar component.

It manages several internal states:

- `selectedTrackId`: The ID of the track selected by the user.
- `results`: The results of the prediction returned by the API.
- `trackOptions`: A list of available tracks that the user can select from. This is populated from the Oracooool API.

## Parameters

There are no parameters received by this component from its parent. All necessary data is fetched within the component using React Hooks(`useEffect`, `useState`) and asynchronous functions for API requests.

## Outputs

There are no specific outputs from this component as it is an operator. The visual output is the rendered HTML including the selection form, prediction button, and displayed prediction results. 

Finally, the component makes sure to handle necessary API calls, manage related states, and render appropriate content on the page.

## Functionality

### `handleTrackSelect` 

The handler function for the track selection dropdown. This sets the selected track variable(`selectedTrackId`) in the component's state.

### `handlePredictClick`

A function that handles the user's request to predict results upon clicking the 'Predict Results' button. It sends a GET request to the oracooool API, waits for the prediction from the API, and updates the results state with the response data. This function also includes error handling for API call failures or the absence of a 'data' property in the response.

### `useEffect` Hook 

This hook is responsible for making an API call to fetch the available tracks when the component mounts. It updates the `trackOptions` variable in the state with the list of available tracks from the API. It ensures error handling for API call failures or the absence of a 'data' property in the response.

The rendered HTML provides a page layout where the user can choose a track, request a prediction, and view the results. Alongside the results, there is also displayed explanation of the prediction service and a logo of the service provider (Oracle Cloud).
