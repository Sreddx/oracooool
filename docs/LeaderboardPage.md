# HomePage.js Documentation

## Summary
The `HomePage.js` file in the `src/pages` directory is a React component that renders the home page of a web application for learning about Formula 1 rules, making predictions, and sharing them with friends.

## Inputs
The HomePage component does not take any inputs. This component is used to display the home page of the application, which includes basic information and a Chatbot component.

## Parameters
There are no parameters for this component as it is a functional component which doesn't receive any props or manage any state.

## Outputs
The output of this component, when rendered, is a `div` element containing a welcome message and encapsulating the `Chatbot` component. This output is then presented to the user in the application's user interface (UI).

## Functionality
The HomePage component is a functional component in react that doesn't have lifecycle methods or state. When the HomePage component is rendered, it returns a JSX markup comprised of a `div` with a welcome message and the `Chatbot` component. The `Chatbot` component allows users to ask anything about the sport. The HomePage component doesn't have any helper functions supporting it because of its simplicity.
Please note that the string "Welcome to the Leaderboard Page" seems to contradict with the actual component name (HomePage). You might want to adjust it accordingly to not confuse users.

This component is then exported for use in other parts of the application.
