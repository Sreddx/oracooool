# Popup Operator

## Summary
This operator is responsible for displaying and managing a modal popup in a web application that includes an integrated Chatbot.

## Inputs
* `Open` button click: The operation leverages the click event on the `Open` button to activate the modal which displays the chatbot.
  
* `Close` button click: There's also an equivalent operation bound to a `Close` button to reverse the operation, hiding the chatbot.

## Parameters
The main parameter in this operation is the `modal` React state variable managed with the `useState` hook. This boolean value controls whether the chatbot modal is shown or hidden.

## Outputs
The operation does not directly output any data or variable. Nevertheless, it manipulates the Document Object Model (DOM) by adding or removing styles and rendering the `Chatbot` component according to whether the modal state is true or false.

## Functionality
The operator uses a couple of functions to manage the `modal` state variable:

* `toggleModal`: this helper function is used to flip the current value of the `modal` variable, effectively toggling the display of the Chatbot.

* Based on the value of `modal`, a `Chatbot` component is rendered inside a modal, and the DOM is manipulated directly to add or remove an 'active-modal' class from the body of the document. This direct DOM manipulation is useful for applying global styles for modal backdrop etc.

Moreover, the code uses React fragment `<> </>` to return multiple elements from the component since React components must return a single parent element.
