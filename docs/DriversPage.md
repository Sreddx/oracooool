# Documentation for SimulationPage operator in React

## Summary

This operator encapsulates the functionality to fetch and display all Formula 1 drivers, including their images, names, nationalities, and team names from a given endpoint and presents it in a formatted grid. The component also includes a prop for a secondary navigation bar.

## Inputs

This operator takes one prop as input: 

- `secondaryNavbar`: This is a React element that display a secondary navigation bar in this component.

## Parameters

- `useState` and `useEffect`: Used to implement React's state and lifecycle features encapsulated in a function component.
- `fetch`: Fetch API provides an interface for fetching resources.
- `Grid`, `Typography`, `Container`: These are Material-UI components that are used within the application for consistent UI and UX design.

## Functionality

- `fetchDrivers` function: This function is called when the page first mounts, and fetches driver data asynchronously from a given endpoint. The function includes error checking and also modifies the data to include additional team information (which is fetched from another endpoint) before setting the state with this updated driver data.
- `useEffect`: This is used to call `fetchDrivers` when the component first mounts.
- Render Functionality: This operator returns a React Fragment that contains both the secondary navigation bar and the list of drivers. For each driver, it displays the driverâ€™s image, name, nationality and team name in a structured, visually pleasing grid.

## Outputs

The main output of this operator is a React component that includes a list of Formula 1 Drivers along with their images, names, nationalities, and team names. It uses the Grid component from Material-UI to present this data in a formed grid layout. The other output is error logs in the console (if applicable); these are generated during the fetching and processing of data if any errors are encountered.
