# Summary

This operator module provides a set of functions for handling exceptions, parsing UUID from a string, and defines a custom Exception subclass `UniqueDBError`. 

# Inputs

- For `format_exception` function, the input is `exception: Exception` which is any Python object of type Exception.
- For `parse_uuid`, the input is `t: str` where `t` is a string from which we are trying to parse a UUID.
- For `UniqueDBError` the input is `msg` which is the exception message provided when an instance of the class is created.

# Parameters

- For the function `format_exception`, `exception: Exception` is the parameter.
- For `parse_uuid`, `t: str` is the parameter.
- For `UniqueDBError` `msg` is the parameter

# Outputs

- `format_exception` function outputs a string representation of the traceback from an Exception.
- `parse_uuid` function outputs an instance of `uuid.UUID`, based on the input string. If the input is not a valid UUID, it will raise a ValueError.
- `UniqueDBError` doesn't produce outputs, rather it's a custom exception type that can be used throughout the application.

# Functionality

- `format_exception` uses the Python stdlib `traceback` module to extract and format the chain of stack frames from the provided exception's traceback. It then converts that into a multi-line string, with each stack frame on its own line.
- `parse_uuid` attempts to convert a string into a UUID object. If the input string is not a valid UUID, or if the input is None, it raises a ValueError.
- `UniqueDBError` is a custom exception type. It adds a `message` attribute to the base `Exception` type so that detailed error messages can be provided when throwing exceptions. Its base functionality is still the same, and it can be caught, rethrown, and so on like any other Exception.
