# Operator Documentation

## Summary
This operator is a comprehensive web application designed to allow users to learn about Formula 1 rules, retrieve current information, interact with a chatbot for queries, make and share predictions, and login for personalised settings and preferences.

## Inputs
This application accepts user input in the form of text for the Chatbot feature, numerical inputs (like formula 1 season representations and prediction estimates) for the Information and Prediction modules. It also accepts credentials during the user login process.

## Parameters
Application parameters comprise key authentication details for user login, machine learning model parameters utilised in the prediction module, and parameters identifying user queries in the Chatbot feature.

## Outputs
The application displays various outputs including Formula 1 rule descriptions, latest formula 1 stats, responses to users' queries, prediction results based on user inputs, and a personalised user dashboard based on login details.

## Functionality
### Run_Step
The `run_step` function is the main driver function of this application. This function contains calls to each module of the application - the Information module to fetch and display Formula 1 data, the Chatbot for query processing, the Predictions module to generate and show forecasted data, and the login module for user authentication and session management.

### Helper Functions
Multiple helper functions support `run_step` for various tasks:

- `fetch_data` function retrieves the latest Formula 1 information from a specific database and transforms it into an easily understandable form.
- `process_query` function in the Chatbot module handles user queries and generates appropriate responses.
- `predict` function employs a machine learning model to produce and output predictions based on user inputs for the Predictions module.
- `user_auth` function manages the user authentication process during login and maintains session details for the user.
