## Summary

This operator is a HomePage function component that uses the Material UI library to create a personalised homepage for a Web application focused on Formula 1 fans. The page allows users to navigate to pages where they can learn more about Formula 1 rules, make predictions using a machine learning model, and interact with the site's chatbot.

## Inputs

This operator requires the following inputs:

- `secondaryNavbar`: This is a component that's inserted at the top of the homepage, offering users the options to navigate to different sections of the website.

## Parameters

This component uses the following parameters:

- The object array `cards`: This is an array of objects, each one representing a card that can be clicked to redirect the user to another part of the web application. Each object contains a `title` (the name of the card), an `imageURL` (the URL of the image to be displayed on the card), and `navigateTo` (the route to the component that the user should be redirected to when clicking on the card).

## Outputs

This operator does not output any conventional data. It renders a series of components to the screen and functions to handle user interactions.

## Functionality 

The main function of this component is to render the homepage of a website, allowing the users to navigate to different parts of the website. 

- Firstly, this HomePage component renders the secondaryNavbar prop and the website logo.
- It then renders a series of cards configured in the aforementioned `cards` constant. Each card displays an image and a title. 
- The cards are clickable. Upon clicking a card, the user is redirected to the route specified in the respective object's `navigateTo` string using the useNavigate hook from the React Router library.

The helper function `navigate(obj.navigateTo)` is called when a user clicks on one of the cards. It uses the `useNavigate` React Router hook to navigate to the location specified by `navigateTo` field in the respective card object.
