# Summary
This Python script is designed to run a Flask web application, with an optional debugging mode.

# Inputs
This script doesn't take any direct inputs. However, it reads an environment variable `IS_DEBUG` to check if the application should run in debugging mode.

# Parameters
- `IS_DEBUG`: An environment variable used to determine if the application needs to run in debugging mode or not. If `IS_DEBUG` is set to `1`, the application will run in debugging mode, while a value of `0` will run it in normal mode.

# Outputs
The script runs a web application and listens for HTTP requests. The output will be dependent on the specific application functionality and can range from simple text to JSON responses and HTML pages. In case the app is running on debug mode, it will output debugging information when errors occur.

# Functionality
The script, first of all, retrieves the environment variable `IS_DEBUG` and converts the value to boolean. Based on the boolean result, the script runs the Flask application in either debug or normal mode.

Some functions referenced but not declared here are:

- `app.run()`: This is an in-built Flask method used to run the application. It starts a development web server that listens for HTTP requests and produces responses.
- `os.getenv()`: This function is used for retrieving the value of environment variable.

The `if __name__ == "__main__":` gate ensures that the Flask server is only run if this script is executed directly, rather than being imported as a module.
