# RulesPage Component Documentation

## Summary 
The `RulesPage` component is a part of a larger web application that helps users learn about Formula 1 rules, teams, and drivers, make predictions, and share them with their friends. 

## Inputs 
The `RulesPage` component receives a `secondaryNavbar` prop, which is a JSX element that renders a secondary navigation bar.

## Parameters 
- `secondaryNavbar`: This JSX element renders a secondary navigation bar.
- `data` and `data2`: This is an array of objects containing titles, explanation text, and image URLs about various Formula rules.
- `Grid` and `Typography`: These are Material-UI components that assist with the layout, alignment, and typography respectively.
 
## Outputs
The `RulesPage` component returns a responsive UI that comprises a page with a heading, a series of cards containing information about the Formula 1 rules, and a footer. Each card displays a title, detailed text, and an image related to a specific topic about Formula 1 rules. 

## Functionality
The `RulesPage` component primarily renders a page containing various sections about Formula 1 rules. 

The rendered page consists of:

1. A `secondaryNavbar` prop that renders a secondary navigation bar.
    
2. A large sized `Grid` component that holds the introductory paragraph.

3. A sequence of `Grid` components created by mapping over the `data` object. Each created `Grid` consists of an image on one side and the title as well as a detailed explanation about a specific rule on the other side. The side on which the image appears alternates with each `Grid`.

4. A `Grid` component that functions as the footer and holds an outro paragraph.

Each of the large `Grid` components (including the introductory and outro paragraphs) possess a background image and an overlay element to provide a dimmed effect.

The `RulesPage` component is structured to be responsive to different screen resolutions while maintaining a fluid layout with Material UI components. 

Note: The `Run_step` function and the helper function are not present in the provided code excerpt.
