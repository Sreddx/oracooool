# Summary
This operator is responsible for handling the "GET" request for all circuits in a Formula 1 web application.

# Inputs
There are no specific inputs for this operator.

# Parameters
There are no parameters for this operator.

# Outputs
The operator returns a JSON response containing information about all the circuits in the Formula 1 database. The response includes a list of circuit objects and the count of circuits.

# Functionality
- The operator defines a Flask Blueprint named "circuits" with the prefix "/circuits".
- It defines a route handler for the "/" endpoint with the "GET" method.
- Inside the route handler, it calls the "get_all_circuits" function from the "f" module to retrieve all circuits.
- It then converts the circuit objects into a list of dictionaries using a list comprehension.
- Finally, it returns a JSON response with the list of circuit dictionaries and the count of circuits. The response has a status code of 200.
