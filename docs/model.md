# Summary
This code defines a Flask Blueprint called "model" that handles requests related to making predictions using a machine learning model trained with historical data.

# Inputs
This operator takes in the following inputs:
- None

# Parameters
This operator does not have any parameters.

# Outputs
This operator produces the following outputs:
- For the "/<circuit_id>" endpoint, it returns a JSON response containing the predictions made by the machine learning model for a given circuit ID.

# Functionality
The code defines two routes for the "model" Blueprint:
- The "/" route with the "GET" method returns a JSON response with an error message indicating an invalid circuit ID.
- The "/<circuit_id>" route with the "GET" method handles requests to make predictions for a specific circuit ID. It first validates the circuit ID using the "parse_uuid" function from the "shared" module. If the circuit ID is valid, it calls the "predict" function from the "model" module to make predictions using the machine learning model. The predictions are then returned in a JSON response.

The code also imports the necessary modules and defines a Flask Blueprint called "model" with the URL prefix "/model".
