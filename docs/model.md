## Summary

The `predict` function in this code is used to fetch and format prediction results for a specific circuit.

## Inputs

The input to the `predict` function is a UUID denoting the circuit for which we would like to fetch prediction data.

## Parameters

The `predict` function has only one parameter:

- `circuit`: A UUID representing a specific circuit.

## Outputs

The output of the `predict` function is a list of `NextResult` objects, each containing prediction data for the input circuit.

## Functionality

The `predict` function does the following operations:

1. Retrieves the prediction data for the given circuit from the database:

   - The function begins by constructing a tuple containing the circuit UUID. 
   - It then closes over a `db_cursor` context manager to ensure the database connection is correctly managed. 
   - Within the context, it executes a pre-defined query (stored in `queries.PREDICT_CIRCUIT`) with the circuit UUID as its input. 
   - It uses the `fetchall` method on the cursor to retrieve all the results.

2. Converts the retrieved results into a list of `NextResult` objects:

   - It then iterates over each result. 
   - For each result, it slices out the relevant attributes, converts them to a `NextResult` object using the `tuple_to_next_result` helper function, and sets the `driver` attribute on the `NextResult` object using `tuple_to_driver`. 
   - It appends each `NextResult` object to a list of predictions.
   
3. The function then returns the list of `NextResult` objects.

The `tuple_to_next_result` and `tuple_to_driver` functions are helper functions used to convert results from the database into a more useable format.
