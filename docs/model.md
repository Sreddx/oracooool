# Documentation for the 'model' Blueprint in Flask Application

## Summary
This operator creates a Flask blueprint named 'model' that handles GET requests to predict outcomes based on a given 'circuit_id', utilizing a machine learning model trained on historical data.

## Inputs
The inputs are HTTP GET methods that request either the base route ("/") or a specific circuit_id ("/<circuit_id>"). 

## Parameters
The parameter for this operator's 'predict' function is 'circuit_id'. This parameter represents the ID of a Formula 1 circuit that a prediction is to be made for.

## Outputs
If the base route ("/") is requested or if a non-UUID 'circuit_id' is provided, an HTTP response with a JSON error message will be returned. 

If a valid 'circuit_id' is supplied, it will go through the machine learning model to make a prediction, and then output a JSON object with the prediction and HTTP status 200.

## Functionality
The 'invalid_predict' function communicates an error message when the base route is accessed without a 'circuit_id'. 

The 'predict' function first attempts to parse the provided 'circuit_id' into a UUID. If it fails to parse, it will output an error message. If the parsing is successful, it will continue on to generate a prediction using the 'predict' function from the imported 'db.func.model'. Lastly, the prediction results are returned as a list of dictionary objects in the HTTP response.

The 'parse_uuid' function takes a string input and verifies whether this string can be parsed as a UUID. If it can be parsed successfully, it returns the parsed UUID. Otherwise, it throws a ValueError. 

The shared 'predict' function from the 'db.func.model' module is used to predict the outcome based on the inserted 'circuit_id'. The prediction is trained from historical Formula 1 data.
