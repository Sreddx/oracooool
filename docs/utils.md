# Documentation

## Summary

This operator defines several functions that convert tuples into objects of specific classes (Driver, Team, Group, User, Circuit, NextResult, Prediction).

## Inputs

The input for each function is a tuple. Each tuple contains the information needed to create a specific object.

## Parameters

These functions don't require additional parameters: only the tuple containing data to convert into a specific object.

## Outputs

The output of each function is an object of one of the classes defined at the beginning of the script, or `None` if the input tuple is `None`.

## Functionality

### tuple_to_driver(data: tuple) -> Driver

This function converts a given tuple into a Driver object. It checks whether the first element of the tuple is not `None` before proceeding. Following elements in the tuple are used to assign attributes to the Driver object created.

### tuple_to_team(data: tuple) -> Team

This function works similarly to the `tuple_to_driver` function but creates a Team object instead.

### tuple_to_group(data: tuple) -> Group

This function creates a Group object from the provided tuple. It follows the same checks as the previously defined functions.

### tuple_to_user(data: tuple) -> User

This function converts a tuple into a User object. Attributes for the user are assigned from the tuple elements.

### tuple_to_circuit(data: tuple) -> Circuit

This function creates a Circuit object from the given tuple. It follows the same steps and procedures as the previous functions.

### tuple_to_next_result(data: tuple) -> NextResult

The function `tuple_to_next_result` converts a tuple data into a NextResult object. It assigns corresponding attributes in the same order as they appear in the tuple.

### tuple_to_prediction(data: tuple) -> Prediction

This function turns the given tuple into a Prediction object. It follows the same procedures as all other similar functions defined in this module.

All functions have error handling to catch exceptions during conversion and print them to the console before returning `None`.
