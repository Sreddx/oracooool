# Documentation for `get_all_drivers` Blueprint Operator

## Summary

This operator is a GET method API endpoint for fetching all the drivers data from the backend database and returning a JSON response containing all the drivers and the total count.

## Inputs

This operator does not have any direct inputs as it is a HTTP GET method.

## Parameters

The `get_all_drivers` functionality does not take any parameters, but uses an imported function `f.get_all_drivers` from the `db.func.drivers` module. This function is expected to connect to the backend database and retrieve all of the driver data.

## Outputs

The output returned by this function is a JSON object with the following keys:

- **drivers**: An array of objects, each object representing a driver. The driver object is obtained by calling the `d` method of the driver object obtained from the database.
  
- **count**: The total count of driver objects retrieved from the database.
  
The HTTP status code "200" is also returned to indicate that the request has succeeded.

## Functionality

The `get_all_drivers` function is a route handler for a Flask Blueprint, specifically for the "/drivers" route's "GET" method.

When this route is called using the "GET" method, it calls the `f.get_all_drivers` function to get all the driver data from the database. The driver data is then converted to a list of driver objects by calling the `d` method of each driver. This is used to populate the "drivers" key in the resulting JSON object.

Additionally, the total count of drivers is included in the JSON response. This count is calculated simply by getting the length of the list of drivers. The JSON response is then returned along with a HTTP status code of "200" to indicate that the request has been handled successfully.
