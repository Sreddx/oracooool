# Teams Module Documentation

## Summary
The Teams module provides a set of RESTful API endpoints, which enable interaction with Formula 1 team data in the system, handling operations like retrieving all teams, a single team by their ID, and drivers of a team.

## Inputs
This module takes in HTTP GET Requests. These requests can either be to fetch all teams, a singular team, or the drivers of a team using the team_id.

## Parameters
- `/teams/` : No parameters. This endpoint retrieves all the Formula 1 teams.

- `/teams/<team_id>/` : The 'team_id' is the unique identifier of the team that is required in order to fetch details of a single team.

- `/teams/<team_id>/drivers/` : The 'team_id' is the unique identifier of the team, which is used to fetch the drivers who belong to that team. The team_id must be a validly formatted UUID.

## Outputs
- `get_all_teams()` : Outputs a JSON response with all the teams represented as dictionaries and the count of teams.

- `get_a_team()` : Outputs a JSON response with a specific team represented as a dictionary, or an error message if an invalid ID was provided or a server error occurred.

- `get_drivers_of_team()` : Outputs a JSON response with all the drivers of a specific team represented as dictionaries, or an error message if an invalid ID was provided or a server error occurred.

## Functionality
The Module is a flask Blueprint with multiple routes:

- `get_all_teams()` function: 
    - Fetches all the teams using the `f.get_all_teams()` function from the imported `db.func` module.
    - It then formats and returns these teams as a JSON response with the total count.

- `get_a_team()` function: 
    - Parses and validates the provided team id.
    - Fetches the specific team from the database using the `f.get_a_team()` function with the parsed team id.
    - In the event of an exception, it is caught, logged and the appropriate response message is sent back.

- `get_drivers_of_team()` function: 
    - This works in a similar fashion to 'get_a_team()', but it gets the drivers of a team by calling the `f.get_drivers_of_team()` function with the parsed team id, returning them as a JSON response.
    - Exceptions are handled similar to `get_a_team()` function.
