## Summary
This code defines a PostgreSQL database connection pool and a context manager function to manage the connections and cursors of the database, so it can handle concurrent access in a multithreaded environment.

## Inputs
- DATABASE CREDENTIALS: The inputs for the pool connection are taken from environment variables. These include `DB_HOST`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, and `DB_PORT`. These are used to establish a connection with the database.

## Parameters
- dbpool: This psycopg2 ThreadedConnectionPool object takes in a minimum and maximum number of connections (`minconn` and `maxconn`), host details (`host`), port details (`port`), database name (`dbname`), username (`user`), and password (`password`). The pool ensures that a new connection doesn't have to be established for every interaction with the database, thus optimizing the process.
- db_cursor: This is a context manager function. It guarantees that the database connection is appropriately managed, including handling errors and transactions; it also ensures the connection is returned to the pool when not in use.

## Outputs
The main output of this operator is a database cursor (`cur`). This cursor can be used to execute SQL commands and fetch data from the PostgreSQL database.

## Functionality
- On calling the context manager function db_cursor, a connection is fetched from the connection pool (`dbpool.getconn()`).
- Within the `try` block, a cursor is obtained from the connection and yielded to the calling function.
- At the end of the block, or if the block completes without issues, the transaction is committed to the database using `conn.commit()`.
- If there are any psycopg2 errors, the transaction is rolled back using `conn.rollback()`. In case of unique constraint violation or any other errors, exceptions are raised carrying appropriate error messages.
- At the end, irrespective of whether operations within the block succeed or fail, the `finally` block is executed to put back the connection to the connection pool using `dbpool.putconn(conn)`. This ensures that the connection pool is effectively managed.
