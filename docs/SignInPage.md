## Summary 

A React component represents the SignIn page for a web application where users can learn about Formula 1 rules, make predictions, and share their predictions with friends. 

## Inputs 

This operator or component has no direct inputs as it's a self-contained React component. 

## Parameters 

1. `username`: A TextField component that allows the user to input their username.
2. `password`: A TextField component that allows the user to input their password.

Both fields are stored in the component's state (`textFieldValues`) and are updated dynamically as the user types in data. There are also error state (`textFieldHasError`) and enabled state (`allTextFieldsHaveValues`) dealing with these fields, that affect the behavior and appearance of the component. 

## Outputs 

This component does not produce any outputs. However, user interactions can trigger side-effects such as navigation to another page or display of error messages.

## Functionality 

This component uses a function called `handleEnterButtonStyles` for enabling or disabling the login button based on whether text fields have values or not.

Another function `handleTextChange` is used for handling the value changes in input fields. It updates the `textFieldValues` state and removes any errors previously set.

The function `attemptLogin` makes a POST request to `/auth/login` endpoint with `textFieldValues` (username and password), navigating to the home page upon a successful response or setting an error otherwise.

This component is then rendered returning a layout with Grid, Card, and TextField components from MUI library which provide a user interface for the user to input their login credentials and submit them. If the entered credentials are incorrect, it will show an error message "Invalid Credentials".
